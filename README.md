# CareApp

Fall and emergency detection mobile system for the elderly, using Bluetooth beacons. This is the implementation of my thesis work; it's an enhanced version of VitaAssist, a group project from my Masters. Only tested on Android phones but it should work on iPhone, too.

Written in C# using Xamarin.Forms
